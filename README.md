# Music Streaming

Stream your music in M3U format with ease!

This project was inspired by the radio feature in the GTA-Multiplayer.cz SA-MP server.

## Features

- Stream your music collection in M3U format.
- Simple and easy-to-use interface.
- Compatible with VLC media player and other M3U-supported players.
- Continuously updated and improved.

## How to Use

1. **Setup PHP Server**: If you have access to a PHP server, open it.
2. **Navigate to My Playlist or Stream Songs**: Browse through your playlist or available songs.
3. **Get Song Link**: Right-click on the song and copy the link.
4. **Open VLC Player**: Launch VLC media player.
5. **Open Network Stream**: Go to `Media` > `Open Network Stream`.
6. **Paste Link**: Paste the copied link into the input field.
7. **Enjoy Music**: Sit back and enjoy your favorite tunes!

## Note

Please note that if a song doesn't work, try to make the song name short. Additionally, there are some files that are not included in the HTML and probably don't work. I still plan on fixing them when I more learn PHP.

## Tested

Tested and run on 000webhost, and it worked.
